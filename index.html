                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br/>
                    They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br/>
                    The farmer said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong></p>
                <p>
                    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                    <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><br/>
                    The farmer again said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong>
                </p>
                <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, 
                    he was thrown and broke his leg. <br/>
                    The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <bad>bad</bad>,</q> and the farmer responded,<strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong></p>
                    
                <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. <br/>
                    Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> <br/>
                    Again, he said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens 
                    in it is <good>good</good> or <bad>bad</bad> <em> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;</em> or, <em>you never know what will be the 
                    consequences of <good>good</good> fortune.</em></p>
